BACKEND-GO

This was built by Temidayo Onifade for the primary aim of sharing my software Engineering journey as a backend developer. 

Backend-go is not out here to replace any available technical blog but just to share the tools i work with, new tools i learnt to use and open source projects i've worked on.

To initialize the project: git clone https://Temidayojnr@bitbucket.org/Temidayojnr/backend-go.git 

After that, run "composer install"

Run "npm install"

Import the SQL file from the project folder,

Run "php artisan migrate"

Run "php artisan make:auth" for authentication.

To run the storage functionality Run "php artisan storage:link"

Then start the server by running "php artisan serve" which will be served on https://localhost:8000 or run it on your port of choice.
